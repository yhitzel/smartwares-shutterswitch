### Pairing

As mentioned before the receiver has six memory positions for being allocated. A remote control needs two of them (for UP and DOWN), which means you're able to pair three sender units. Before pairing you have to activate the pairing mode by pressing the button on the front side for about three seconds until the LED starts blinking. Now you have to press the button on your remote control which shall be mapped to the DOWN command. Afterwards you do the same with the button for the UP command. If the LED now turns off your sender unit is successfully paired with the receiver.
